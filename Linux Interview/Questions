Based on my Understanding:
**What is the Linux kernel?**
Kernel is the Heart of Linux Operating System. Mainly it serves as bridge between Hardware and software components. It is responsible for managing system resources and porive core functionalties./
Explain the difference between a soft link and a hard link? These are two types of links whoch allow multiple filename to be associated with same file or dir. there are some major difference
Soft link: It is a Symbolic link, it is a seperate file, which contains a refrence to target file or dir. It is a pointer to another file.
Hard link: It refers to inode(contains file or dir information) it create multope dir entires to same inode.
Major difference: 1. If targer file is deleted or moved, soft link becomes invalid, hard link remains same.
2. Soft link can span file system where as hard link should stay on same file system. 
3. Soft link have independent permissions, where hard links should have same permissions.
